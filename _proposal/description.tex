\chapter*{Project Description}

We built an artificial intelligence (AI) actor that can play Super Smash Bros. (SSB) as the character Kirby.
%The end-of-term goal is to be able to defeat an average human opponents in real-time.
We set out to be able to defeat an average human player; our project timeline did not allow for such performance.

Although our original goal was not met, we were able to accomplish many large subgoals. 
First, we constructed a framework for any generic AI agent to play SSB using the open source Project64 Emulator.
Second, we implemented three neural network layer prediction algorithms including: Perceptron, ReLU, and Linear. 
Third, we implemented a parameterized neural network construction that allows building networks of various sizes.
Finally, we integrated all of these pieces and did performance analysis with various levels of parallelization throughout the implemented network.

Our AI engine performs a major computation, forward propagation through a deep neural network, to determine the best next action for Kirby given the current state and action. 
Our target performance is to be able to calculate the next action of the AI engine every $k^{th}$ frame. 
This means we want to perform this AI work approximately 15 times per second, or at a rate of $66ms$ per engine output.
We easily achieve this performance through parallelization of the AI engine.
