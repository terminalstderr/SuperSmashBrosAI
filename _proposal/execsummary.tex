\chapter*{Executive Summary}

The Office of Strategic National Alien Planning (OSNAP) has made a substantial investment in a mech defense system titled Kirby. 
As part of the acquisition, a simulation system Super Smash Bros. (SSB) was provided for training our Kirby effectively.
K-AID is an artifical intelligence engine we created to control Kirby in SSB.

K-AID gathers state information directly from the simulation's memory space about Kirby and the opponnent.
Included in this information is location, velocity, acceleration, enemy action, damage dealt, and finally life loss.
We pack all of this information into a reinforcement learning model consisting of state, action, and reward.
Using this model, K-AID determines a correct action to take in order to maximize future reward (i.e. destroying the enemy without loss of life).
The technique used is reinforcement learning implemented using a parallelized deep neural network.
